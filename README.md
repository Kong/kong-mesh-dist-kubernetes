- Use https://github.com/Kong/kong-dist-kubernetes to run Kong
- Start a Service B that uses ncat to listen on 8080
- Start a Service A that sends `date` to Service B
- Start Kong as a mesh sidecar in the same pod as Service A
- Configure Kong and the pod iptables to send all traffic transparently through Kong
